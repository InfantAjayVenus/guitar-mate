# PWA Screenshots

This directory should contain screenshots of your application for use in app stores and PWA install prompts.

Replace these placeholder files with actual screenshots of your application:

1. `metronome-screen.png` - Screenshot of the metronome feature
2. `timer-screen.png` - Screenshot of the practice timer feature
3. `settings-screen.png` - Screenshot of the settings screen

These screenshots should ideally be 1080x1920 pixels for mobile devices.

## PWA Best Practices

- Make sure screenshots accurately represent the app's appearance
- Include key features in your screenshots
- Use high-quality images
- Consider different device sizes and orientations
